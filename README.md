## Hi there 👋

My name is Seong, I’m passionate about using data and machine learning to solve commercial problems. I love turning complex data and intimidating numbers into clear, data-driven commercial and financial strategy.

My background in management consulting gave me hands-on experience helping clients improve operations and make strategic decisions under uncertainty. Over time, I realised my favourite part of every project was the quantitative core — cleaning messy data, building predictive models, and uncovering patterns that drive measurable impact.

- 💬 Ask me anything about personal finance! I can spend hours chatting about ETFs, tax savings accounts, portfolio construction, or financial independence!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating machine learning and statistical models to refine investment strategies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning and monte carlo simulation
